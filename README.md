# Leprechaun Miner
Leprechaun is a tiny program that lives in your system tray. It mines Ethereum, Monero, and other cryptocurrencies in the background while you work. A configuration file allows you to fine-tune which miners work at what time of day, while you are afk, etc.

Leprechaun is intended for individuals who would like to take advantage of their computer‚Äôs power, even when they aren‚Äôt at the keyboard. This program provides tools to customize the mining process so it is as invisible and unobtrusive as possible. A short list of features includes:

- 0% developer fee, except for the towards mining pools and closed-source backends;
- Dashboard with all your earnings in one place, as well as daily and pending earnings;
- Toggling mining based on your AFK status;
- Toggling mining based on the time of day;
- Toggling mining based on day of the week.
