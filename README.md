# Leprechaun üçÄ
Leprechaun is a tiny program that lives in your system tray. It mines Ethereum, Monero, and other cryptocurrencies in the background while you work.  
A configuration file allows you to fine-tune which miners work, at what time of day, while you are afk, etc.

Leprechaun requires Windows 10, 64-bit.

## Installation
To install Leprechaun, execute the following command in powershell:

<table><tr><td>
‚ö†Ô∏è <b>NOTE:</b> Always verify the security and contents of any script from the internet you are not familiar with.
</td></tr></table>

```
iex (iwr https://github.com/andreasxp/leprechaun/releases/download/0.3.2/install-leprechaun.ps1)
```
This will download and execute a script which will install leprechaun to your appdata folder. On first launch, Leprechaun will prompt you to configure your miners as you wish.
The configuration file will be located in `~/leprechaun.yml`.
